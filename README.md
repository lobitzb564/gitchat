# gitchat

This is a chat interface I made my junior year of highschool to cap off my GachaOS project. This part was a little bit of a joke, and was mostly just experimentation.
It uses github issues as chat messages to communcate across computers. I was unable to actually communicate across computers using a sensible method because of network limitations on our school's
wifi. The most interesting part of this project for me was having to design a custom text input interface. This chat interface is desined as a plugin for the Gnome desktop for ArchLinux.
The Gnome library does not include a text input, so I had to write code to manually capture, decode, display, and record all keyboard inputs that occured when the chat interface was selected.
